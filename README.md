# GIF-7104-Parallel Programming TPs Repository
#### TP1: Parallelize sieve of Eratosthene
========================================
In this this assignment we were asked to begin with a sequential version
of the algorithm and to parallelize it using the "pthread" library in C.

We have produce a rapport that details all the steps that we made to accomplish that
task and produce the results we wanted.

For more details clone the repository than  in the SourceFile folder run the two
commands:

```C
cmake .
